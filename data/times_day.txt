at the precise moment of noon
during the longest hour of afternoon
when shadows point directly east
as morning fog lifts from the valley
in the golden hour before sunset
at the instant coffee goes cold
when church bells finish their count
during a brief gap in the clouds
as the last school bus passes
when morning turns reluctantly to afternoon
at the hour nobody remembers
during the pause between breaths
as sunlight hits the western wall
when time briefly forgets to move
at the moment of uncomfortable silence
during the warmest part of the day
as clocks strike an impossible hour
when daylight begins to tire
at the instant of realization
during the minutes everyone ignores
