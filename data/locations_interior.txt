a dimly lit apothecary
an abandoned ballroom covered in dust
a cathedral with broken stained glass
a cramped submarine cabin
the basement of a clock tower
a Victorian greenhouse at midnight
an empty cinema showing static
a flooded library
the inside of a whale's stomach
a room where all the furniture is on the ceiling
a telephone booth that goes underground
the back room of a taxidermy shop
a kitchen where everything is made of glass
an attic full of unfinished portraits
a wine cellar with no exit
the interior of a giant music box
a hospital ward from another century
a train compartment that never stops
an elevator stuck between floors
a bathroom tiled with mirrors
a puppet theater after closing
the stomach of a mechanical dragon
a wardrobe that leads nowhere
a dentist's office in a dream
a sauna that smells of lavender and fear
