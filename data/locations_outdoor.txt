a salt flat under three moons
the edge of a frozen waterfall
a garden where all flowers face inward
a beach of black volcanic sand
the top of an unfinished skyscraper
a cemetery for ships
a field of solar panels at sunset
the bottom of a dry reservoir
a forest of petrified trees
a rooftop covered in beehives
the ruins of a drive-in theater
a parking lot full of abandoned ambulances
a bridge that spans nothing
a playground overgrown with ivy
the crater of a dormant volcano
a train yard at 3 AM
a boardwalk during a hurricane
a cornfield with paths cut in spirals
the space between two skyscrapers
a lighthouse with no ocean
a garden of satellite dishes
the roof of a moving train
a quarry filled with rainwater
a cliff above a sea of clouds
a desert where snow falls
