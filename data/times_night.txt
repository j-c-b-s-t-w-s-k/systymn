at the hour when nightmares begin
during the silence between heartbeats
when the moon hides its face
at 3 AM exactly
as streetlights flicker in sequence
during the longest minute of midnight
when shadows become their own masters
at the moment insomnia wins
as stars rearrange themselves
when night considers becoming permanent
during the hours that don't exist
at the precise instant of doubt
as the last bar closes its doors
when darkness forgets its purpose
at the hour owls fall silent
during the minutes time ignores
as the world holds its breath
when dreams bleed into reality
at the edge of almost-morning
during the pause before dawn remembers
