a pocket watch that runs backwards
an envelope sealed with black wax
a typewriter with no letter Q
a compass that points to regret
a photograph of someone you'll meet tomorrow
a key that opens nothing
a music box playing an unknown song
a jar of preserved lightning
a telescope that shows the past
a book with all pages blank except the last
a mirror that reflects a different room
a candle that burns green
a letter addressed to nobody
a map of a country that doesn't exist
a pair of glasses that show lies
a radio that only plays static
a clock with thirteen hours
a phone that rings when nobody calls
a suitcase full of sand
a snow globe of your childhood home
a chess piece from an incomplete set
a doorknob without a door
an hourglass filled with salt
a bottle containing a miniature storm
a photograph that changes when you're not looking
